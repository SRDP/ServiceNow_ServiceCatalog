= CloudForms ServiceNow_ServiceCatalog

The purpose of this project is to provide a starting point for integrating Red Hat (R) https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/cloudforms[Red Hat CloudForms] and ServiceNow's Service Catalog.

=== Import Update Set

Download the update set to your desktop: link:https://github.com/ramrexx/ServiceNow_ServiceCatalog/blob/master/update_set/ServiceNow-CloudForms-Application.xml[ServiceNow CloudForms Application]

* Log into your ServiceNow instance
* Navigate to *Retrieved Update Sets* and click on *Import Update Set from XML*

* Upload the *ServiceNow CloudForms Application.xml*
* Within the retrieved update set click on *Preview Update Set*

=== Gather Required Information

Before you can integrate ServiceNow with CloudForms you *MUST* gather the following pieces of information from CloudForms.

** <<SERVICECATALOG_ID>>
** <<SERVICETEMPLATE_ID>>
** <<CloudForms Credentials>>

=== SERVICECATALOG_ID

There is currently no *EASY* way to get the SERVICECATALOG_ID from CloudForms in the UI. So we will need to use an API call to pull back the id.

* Use SSH to log into CloudForms as root
* Execute the following command to pull back a list service catalog ids:

 curl -k -u admin:smartvm -X GET https://localhost/api/service_catalogs?expand=resources | python -m json.tool|grep \"id -A 1 -B 2

  "description": "Cloud Service Catalog",
  "href": "https://localhost/api/service_catalogs/12000000000003",
  "id": 12000000000003,
  "name": "Cloud Service Catalog",
  "description": "Infrastructure Service Catalog",
  "href": "https://localhost/api/service_catalogs/12000000000002",
  "id": 12000000000002,
  "name": "Infrastructure Service Catalog",

NOTE: Take note of the SERVICECATALOG_ID that you want because you will need it for the next step!

=== SERVICETEMPLATE_ID

There is currently no *EASY* way to get the SERVICETEMPLATE_ID from CloudForms in the UI. So we will need to use an API call to pull back the id.

* Using the SERVICECATALOG_ID from the previous step we can now if we explore the Service Catalog's service_templates (or catalog items).
* Execute the following command to pull back a list service_template ids:

 curl -k -u admin:smartvm -X GET https://localhost/api/service_catalogs/12000000000002/service_templates?expand=resources | python -m json.tool|grep \"id -A5 -B2

   "guid": "3ea7c49c-9a1d-11e6-96c6-000c29066205",
   "href": "https://localhost/api/service_catalogs/12000000000002/service_templates/12000000000003",
   "id": 12000000000003,
   "long_description": "",
   "miq_group_id": 12000000000002,
   "name": "VMware - RHEL7",
   "options": {},
   "prov_type": "vmware",

NOTE: Take note of the SERVICETEMPLATE_ID that you want because you will need it for the next step!

==== CloudForms Credentials

TIP: For some reason when making REST message `post` calls to CloudForms the username gets stripped from the api call. This only seems to effect ServiceNow Geneva or newer so this is my work-a-around for now!

* Use SSH to log into CloudForms as root.

  curl -v -k -u admin:smartvm -X GET https://localhost/api/ 2>&1 /dev/null | grep Auth

  > Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46c21hcnR2bQ==

NOTE: Copy your encoded credentials somwhere because you will need them in the next step!

=== Install and configure a MID Server

The MID Server is a small application that runs in your environment. Its sole purpose is to execute REST calls on behalf of ServiceNow behind your firewall. It monitors ServiceNow's ecc_queue for tasks that it needs process. So for ServiceNow to make a REST call to your Cloudforms server bhind your firewall you will need a MID Server.

* Log into your ServiceNow instance
* Navigate to MID Server *Downloads* and download the appropriate (ZIP) package

image:documentation/images/snow-mid-server-download.png[link=documentation/images/snow-mid-server-download.png]

NOTE: You can run the MID server anywhere. I chose to download the Linux 64-bit package on my CloudForms appliance into the `/root/servicenow` director.

* Extract the ZIP into a directory
* Edit the ./servicenow/agent/config.xml and change the following *REQUIRED* parameters:
** `url`
** `mid.instance.username`
** `mid.instance.password`
** `name`

NOTE: You must put the password in clear text. But don't worry it will encrypt the password as soon as you start the MID server. Also, if your MID Server requires a proxy server to get to your instance you can specify proxy infomration in the *COMMON OPTIONAL* parameters section.

* Start the MID Server service by running `./start.sh`
* Log back into your ServiceNow intance
* Navigate to MID Server *Servers*

=== Configure ServiceNow Catalog Item

* Log into your ServiceNow instance.
* Navigate to *REST Message*

image:documentation/images/snow-rest-message-list.png[link=documentation/images/snow-rest-message-list.png]

* Select one of the *pre-built* CloudForms messages.

TIP: You can create your own REST Message here if you want.

* Currently there are samples for VMware, RHEV, Openstack and Amazon.
* At the bottom of the REST Message record select `post`.

image:documentation/images/snow-rest-message-select-post.png[link=documentation/images/snow-rest-message-select-post.png]

* Update the `post` REST Message endpoint with the following:
** IP/Hostname of your CloudForms appliance
** SERVICECATALOG_ID



* This is is where you will define what JSON parameters will be passed to CloudForms.
