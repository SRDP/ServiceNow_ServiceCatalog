= Configure REST Message

The REST Message is where the `endpoint`, `HTTP Headers`, `MID Server` and `JSON Payload` are configured. The `CloudForms Application` update set contains many samples that you can use to quickly demonstrate this integration.

== Table of Contents

** <<Configure REST Message>>
** <<Modify Post Endpoint>>
** <<Choose MID Server>>
** <<Enter Credentials>>
** <<Modify JSON Payload>>

=== Configure REST Message

* Log into your ServiceNow instance.
* Navigate to *REST Message*
* Select one of the *pre-built* CloudForms REST messages that you would like to use.

* At the bottom of the REST Message record select `post`.

<<top>>

=== Modify Post Endpoint

* Unlock the `post` REST Message endpoint and update the `CLOUDFORMS.EXAMPLE.COM` with the hostname/IP address of your CloudForms appliance.

* You will need to substitute `SERVICECATALOG_ID` for your CloudForms Service_Catalog ID of the item that you wish to provision.
* You can get this information by running the following:

 curl -k -u admin:smartvm -X GET https://localhost/api/service_catalogs?expand=resources | python -m json.tool|grep \"id -A 1 -B 2

** Output:

  "description": "Cloud Service Catalog",
  "href": "https://localhost/api/service_catalogs/12000000000003",
  "id": 12000000000003,
  "name": "Cloud Service Catalog",
  "description": "Infrastructure Service Catalog",
  "href": "https://localhost/api/service_catalogs/12000000000002",
  "id": 12000000000002,
  "name": "Infrastructure Service Catalog",

  *** As shown above *12000000000003* is the Id of the `Cloud Service Catalog`
  *** As shown above *12000000000002* is the Id of the `Infrastructure Service Catalog`

* So that your `endpoint` would look something like this:

 https://mycloudforms.example.com/api/service_catalogs/12000000000002/service_templates

<<top>>

=== Choose MID Server

* Locate and choose your MID Server

<<top>>

=== Enter Credentials

* You then need to enter your own encoded credentials in the `authorization` HTTP Header.
* You can get this information by running the following:

 curl -v -k -u admin:smartvm -X GET https://localhost/api/ 2>&1 /dev/null | grep Auth

  > Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46c21hcnG2bQ==

NOTE: Copy your encoded credentials into the `authorization` HTTP Header.

=== Modify JSON Payload

* Locate and Modify the HTTP Query payload. This is where the JSON structure that is passed to CloudForms lives.

image:images/snow-rest-message-httpquery.png[link=images/snow-rest-message-httpquery.png]

* You will need to substitute `SERVICETEMPLATE_ID` for your CloudForms Service_Template ID that you wish to provision.
* You can get this information by running the following (substitute SERVICECATALOG_ID with your ID from above):

 curl -k -u admin:smartvm -X GET https://localhost/api/service_catalogs/SERVICECATALOG_ID/service_templates?expand=resources | python -m json.tool|grep \"id -A5 -B2

** Output:

   "guid": "3ea7c49c-9a1d-11e6-96c6-000c29066205",
   "href": "https://localhost/api/service_catalogs/12000000000002/service_templates/12000000000003",
   "id": 12000000000003,
   "long_description": "",
   "miq_group_id": 12000000000002,
   "name": "VMware - RHEL7",
   "options": {},
   "prov_type": "vmware",

  *** As shown above *12000000000003* is the Id of the *VMware - RHEL7* catalog item in CloudForms.

* Update the HTTP Query JSON payload with the `SERVICETEMPLATE_ID` so that your `href` would look something like this:

  "href" : "https://mycloudforms.example.com/api/service_templates/12000000000003"

* Click on `Update` to save your changes.
