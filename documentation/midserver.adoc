= Install and Configure MID Server

The MID Server is a small application that runs in your environment. Its sole purpose is to execute REST calls on behalf of ServiceNow behind your firewall. It monitors ServiceNow's `ecc_queue` for tasks that it needs process. What does this mean? For ServiceNow to make REST calls to your Cloudforms appliance behind your firewall you will need a MID Server!

=== Install MID Server

* Log into your ServiceNow instance
* Navigate to MID Server *Downloads* and download the appropriate (ZIP) package

NOTE: You can run the MID server anywhere in your environment. For *testing* purposes only you may choose to download the Linux 64-bit package onto your CloudForms appliance. If you do use the `/opt` directory.

* Extract the ZIP into a directory.

<<top>>

=== Configure MID Server

* Open the /opt/agent/config.xml using your favorite editor.
* Make the following changes:

** `<parameter name="url" value="https://YOUR_INSTANCE.service-now.com"/>`
** `<parameter name="mid.instance.username" value="YOUR_INSTANCE_USER_NAME_HERE" />`
** `<parameter name="mid.instance.password" value="YOUR_INSTANCE_PASSWORD_HERE" encrypt="true"/>`
** `<parameter name="name" value="YOUR_MIDSERVER_NAME_GOES_HERE"/>`

NOTE: You must put the password in clear text. But don't worry it will encrypt the password as soon as you start the MID server.

* Start the MID Server service by running:

 /opt/agent/start.sh

<<top>>

=== Validate MID Server

* Log into your ServiceNow instance.
* Navigate to *MID Server* Servers
* By now you should see your MID Server instance but it has not been validated.
* Validate the MID Server

=== Start MID Server

TIP: Optionally you can set the MID Server Service to automatically start.

* Create a file called /etc/systemd/system/*mid.server* and copy the contents below to it.

[source, ini]
----

[Unit]
Description=ServiceNow MID Server
After=syslog.target
After=network.target

[Service]
PIDFile=/opt/agent/work/mid.pid

ExecStart=/opt/agent/bin/mid.sh start

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
----
* Configure the ServiceNow MID Server Service

 systemctl daemon-reload
 systemctl start mid
 systemctl enable mid

<<top>>

=== Troubleshooting MID Server

* Logging - If your MID Server is not showing up you can look at the /opt/servicenow/agent/logs/agent0.log.0.

* Validate - Ensure that your MID Server has been validated otherwise it will be to execute tasks coming from ServiceNow.

* Connectivity - If your MID Server requires a proxy to get to the ServiceNow instance you can specify proxy settings in `/opt/servicenow/agent/config.xml` under the *COMMON OPTIONAL* parameters section.
